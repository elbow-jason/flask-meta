flask-meta
==========

Using a Flask app to make more Flask apps. So meta.


#####Then and Now
   + Then: Chickens make eggs. Eggs make chickens.
   + Now: Flask makes apps. Apps make... apps... (that was not a good analogy)

#####Quick Start

1. Make a virtualenv for your meta app: 
   + `$ virtualenv my_appmeta`
1. Change dir into the venv: 
   + `$ cd my_appmeta`
1. Activate the venv:
   + `$ activate bin/activate` <-- this is for bash
   + `$ activate bin/activate.fish` <-- this is for fish (i use fish btw)
1. Clone this repo:
   + `$ git clone https://github.com/jlgoldb2/flask-meta.git`
   + (omg this document can copy itself; similar to flask-meta!!)
1. Change dir into flask-meta:
   + `$ cd flask-meta`
1. Python the setup:
   + `$ python setup.py install`
